# PaperMario
A Paper Mario: The Origami King battle solver because I was too tired to do puzzles

## Setup
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Done
- solving arbitrary enemy alignment for arbitrary number of moves
- better board input functionality
- graphical output

## Todo:
- separate board logic and solver logic
- handle multiple enemy types (partially implemented in GUI)
- BOSS LOGIC
- use breadth-first search in checkSolution
- show solution in GUI
- make GUI playable
