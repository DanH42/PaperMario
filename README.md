# PaperMario
A Paper Mario: The Origami King battle solver because I was too tired to do puzzles

Done: solving arbitrary enemy alignment for arbitrary number of moves

Todo:
- separate board logic and solver logic
- handle multiple enemy types
- better board input functionality
- graphical output
- BOSS LOGIC
